		How to increase sustainability in your diet
	</h2>
<body>
	<p> There are many reasons individuals pursue a plant based lifestyle. It is a common misconception that ethics are the only reason. A major reason to minimize animal products in your daily life is <em>enviornmental impact</em>. Large scale livestock farms can be very bad for the enviornment. Runoff from animal waste creates high nitrogen concentrations in water which in turn can lead to death of aquatic life. Additionally, cramped living conditions and high waste production can result in overuse of land. If you choose to consume livestock meat at all, make sure it is sustainably sourced. 
	</p>
<h2> How can we do this? </h2>	
	<p> One way to increase sustainaility of meat consumption is to shop local. Small scale livestock farms are much more enviornmentlly sustainable, and often the lives of the animals are much better as well. You can find small scale animals products at local farmers markets and locally owned butchers. An added benefit of shopping for meat locally is that is supports local the local economy and allows small businesses to keep doors open.
	</p>
<h2> But what if I can't?</h2>
	<p> Although consuming locally sourced meat products is ideal, it is not possible for everyone. Food deserts are regions with a lack of fresh food items, often including meat. Due to this, the price of these items is extremely inflated. These areas are often made up of low income families who cannot afford the steep prices of high quality, fresh goods. One way to combat this is to continue to open farmers markets. Opening a local market can increase accessibility of the available products to the residents of the area. This can help bring fresher products at a lower price to individuals who cannot purchase these items at local grocery stores. A great thing about markets is the ability to purchase goods using a bartering system, which is more feasible to some individuals than monetary exchange.

	<li>Buy sustainable and ethically sourced meats from butchers/ reputable grocery stores</li>
	<li>If there are no farmer's markets in your area, think about strating one!</li>
